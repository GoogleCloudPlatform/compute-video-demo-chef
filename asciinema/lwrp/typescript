$ # We'll use the Google Compute Engine LWRP to create 4 virtual machines,
$ # a load-balancer, and open up a firewall rule for HTTP traffic.  The new
$ # VMs will be bootstrapped into our Chef environment and we'll also install

$ 
$ # We assume you have already set up your Google Cloud Platform project,
$ # installed the Open Source Chef Server, created and configured a Chef
$ # Workstation, and have configured the knife utility.
$ 
$ # This screencast picks up at the "Cookbook and Demo setup" section of the
$ # README.  As such, we are now logged into our configured Chef Workstation
$ # and are ready to proceed.

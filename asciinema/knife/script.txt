# This screencast demonstrates how you can use Chef and the knife-google
# plugin for Google Compute Engine.  Everything you need to repeat this demo
# on your own can be found at,
# https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/compute-video-demo-chef
#
# We assume you have already set up your Google Cloud Platform project,
# installed the Open Source Chef Server, created and configured a Chef
# Workstation, and have configured the knife utility.
#
# Let's just check to make sure we're starting with a clean slate,
cd ~/chef-repo
knife node list

# Ok, let's get started!  First, we want to make sure our Chef Workstation
# running on a Compute Engine instance has a valid Compute Engine SSH key
# and it is registered with the metadata server. This will give us sudo
# access on new instances.  We can use `gcloud compute`,
gcloud compute ssh $(hostname -s)

# It's OK that this failed on a zone lookup. The SSH key was still created
# and uploaded to the metadata server.

# Let's install the knife-google utility,
sudo /opt/chef/embedded/bin/gem install knife-google --no-rdoc --no-ri

# Now we need to set up the authorization. You will need to have created a
# new Client ID (for native application) so that you can provide the
# *Client ID* and *Client secret*. Once you supply the necessary bits, you
# will need to copy/paste the URL into an authenticated browser session
# to obtain the auth token that you need to copy/paste back into the the
# terminal,
knife google setup

# We can verify that authorization was set up correctly with,
knife google zone list

# Ok, let's create a new instance and watch it get bootstrapped
knife google server create knife-test \
  -m n1-standard-1 \
  -I debian-7-wheezy-v2014060 \
  -Z us-central1-b \
  -i ~/.ssh/google_compute_engine \
  -x $USER

# Does the Chef Server know about it?
knife node list

# Ohai has hints for Compute Engine built in too!
knife node show knife-test -a gce | less

# Success!
exit
